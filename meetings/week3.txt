Week 3 of the project was spent getting the "hand shake" between the client and server completely
down. Once we did that, we were able to focus on getting multiple clients to be able to chat
to each other via the server. Once the connection was facilitated, it was just a manner of 
configuring the strings in a way that they could be transmitted over the socket.
