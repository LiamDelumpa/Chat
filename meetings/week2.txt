This week we have met once. This meeting was to go over the progress that each of us had
made. It turns out that both of us have been encountering problems. Ryan's main problem was that 
the server only allows one connection at a time. Liam's main problem is making the connection
with the server socket. In this meeting we had to clarify with each other what type of socket
we were using and how we were going to facilitate this connection between the client and the server.
Although these details should have been discussed in week 1, limited knowledge of client/server
technology restricted us from considering these dilemmas. We hope to complete the server and client
by Sunday 2/22.
