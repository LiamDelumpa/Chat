In week 1 we met once. This meeting was meant to delegate roles, and figure out due dates
of deliverables. We decided that Liam will be doing the client, while Ryan completes the server.
The expected due date of this would be Sunday 2/22. This should give us enough time to get our code
working together, and to start the next subset of our application.
